# Network Security Analysis: TCP SYN Flood Attack Case Study

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze network security incidents using Wireshark logs to identify and explain a TCP SYN flood attack targeting a company's web server.

## 📋 Scenario
As a security analyst at a travel agency, I investigated a server disruption affecting the company's sales webpage. The incident involved:

- 🚫 Connection timeout errors for employees accessing the sales portal
- ⚠️ Automated monitoring system alerts  
- 📊 Abnormal network traffic patterns
- 🔽 Server performance degradation

## 🛠️ Technical Analysis
I analyzed network traffic captured during the incident using:
- Wireshark packet capture analysis
- TCP/HTTP log examination
- Network traffic pattern recognition  
- Protocol-specific behavior analysis (TCP three-way handshake)

## 🎯 Key Findings
- ✅ Identified TCP SYN flood attack from IP 203.0.113.0
- ✅ Analyzed attack progression through log timestamps
- ✅ Documented impact on legitimate user connections
- ✅ Mapped attack patterns against normal TCP behavior

## 📈 Attack Characteristics

### Initial Phase
- Normal TCP connections functioning
- Server responding to legitimate requests
- Attack IP establishing initial connections

### Attack Progression
- Rapid increase in SYN requests
- Server resource exhaustion
- Failed legitimate connection attempts
- Connection timeout errors

### Impact Analysis
- Server resource depletion
- Degraded response times
- Failed TCP handshakes
- Service interruption for legitimate users

## 🛡️ Mitigation Steps

### Immediate Response
- Server taken offline temporarily
- Firewall rules updated
- Malicious IP blocked
- System recovery monitoring

### Long-term Recommendations
- SYN flood protection implementation
- Network monitoring enhancement
- Firewall rule optimization
- DDoS mitigation strategy
