# Network Security Analysis: TCP SYN Flood Attack Case Study

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze network security incidents using Wireshark logs to identify and explain a TCP SYN flood attack targeting a company's web server.

## Scenario
As a security analyst at a travel agency, I investigated a server disruption affecting the company's sales webpage. The incident involved:
- Connection timeout errors for employees accessing the sales portal
- Automated monitoring system alerts
- Abnormal network traffic patterns
- Server performance degradation

## Technical Analysis
I analyzed network traffic captured during the incident using:
- Wireshark packet capture analysis 
- TCP/HTTP log examination
- Network traffic pattern recognition
- Protocol-specific behavior analysis (TCP three-way handshake)

### Key Findings
- Identified TCP SYN flood attack from IP 203.0.113.0
- Analyzed attack progression through log timestamps
- Documented impact on legitimate user connections
- Mapped attack patterns against normal TCP behavior

### Attack Characteristics
1. Initial Phase:
   - Normal TCP connections functioning
   - Server responding to legitimate requests
   - Attack IP establishing initial connections

2. Attack Progression:
   - Rapid increase in SYN requests
   - Server resource exhaustion
   - Failed legitimate connection attempts
   - Connection timeout errors

3. Impact Analysis:
   - Server resource depletion
   - Degraded response times
   - Failed TCP handshakes
   - Service interruption for legitimate users

## Mitigation Steps
1. Immediate Response:
   - Server taken offline temporarily
   - Firewall rules updated
   - Malicious IP blocked
   - System recovery monitoring

2. Long-term Recommendations:
   - SYN flood protection implementation
   - Network monitoring enhancement
   - Firewall rule optimization
   - DDoS mitigation strategy
